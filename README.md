# StackOverflow Anonymize Links Chrome Extension

When you use the "share" function on any question or answer on the StackExchange network (which includes StackOverflow, Super User, Server Fault, and many others), the generated link includes your account ID.

The StackOverflow Anonymize Links Chrome Extension automatically removes your user ID from shared links on all sites in the StackExchange network. This ensures your shared links are neutral and cannot be traced back to your account, protecting your identity.
